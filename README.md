# üé∏ Django Rockaria

Django Rockaria is a web application built with Django HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Java. I designed this project showcase the power of a structured backend paired with dynamic content. This project is based on a one music event (One Day Only).

# Info About The Concert

## My First Project Of This Nature

- Venue is Towneley Park Burnley, Lancashire (Outdoor Event)
- Date Planned 4th July 2026
- Ticket Price ¬£25.00 Each


# Method Of Building

Within Microsoft Visual Studio Code, using Django, Python and 
Java I set about designing and building the framework
to create Rockaria. The idea of Rockaria came about from 
my love of music and live concerts.
Also within this project I have also used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
Typeface and other designs are from Font Awesome and also Google Fonts.
Making sure the site is responsive across different devices.
As this is my first Django project throughout I faced challenges and 
also some demanding issues which needed thought and processes to
remedy problems along the way.

The site is deployed to Heroku.

Within the layout from the homepage, starting at the top is the 
navigation bar. Within this there is a decorative home link, also
on the right hand side of the navbar there is a link to take you to
a ticket booking page and an account section, where you can register
login etc.

Onto the middle section of the landing page an informative section 
with more information along with large buttons to highlight the bands on stage
and info regarding the location of the concert.

At the bottom there is the footer section with links to a contact form,
social media copyright and terms.

# More information

Rockaria has started its first stage hosting a one day live outdoor
music event.

I feel this is only the start, this can be expanded to not only
more events but in changing line ups and area planning.
